NodeJS works by executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser,
allowing developers to build server-side applications using JavaScript.
Nginx works by handling incoming requests from clients and forwarding
them to the appropriate backend server to handle the request.

3. What are the dependencies of NodeJS?

NodeJS has several dependencies, including the V8 JavaScript engine and various
NodeJS modules. These dependencies are required for NodeJS to function properly.

4. What is NPM?

NPM stands for Node Package Manager. It is a package manager for NodeJS that
allows developers to easily install and manage packages and dependencies for
their NodeJS projects.

5. What is reverse proxy?

A reverse proxy is a server that sits between client devices and backend servers.
It intercepts requests from clients and forwards them to the appropriate backend
server to handle the request. Reverse proxies are commonly used for load balancing,
caching, and security purposes.
